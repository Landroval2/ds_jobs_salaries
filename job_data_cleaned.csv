★★★★★Former Medicare Sales Agent
Accrued PTO can be used for sick days and vacation, however, there are blackout dates during AEP. You are not valued as a human being- you are just part of the headcount. No matter how far in advance you request time off as a courtesy to the employer, you will not get the same respect in return. You'll wait until last minute to learn of approval which affects morale. You should be aware if you resign, you will not be allowed to take paid time off in your final weeks and you will forfeit any accrued time. You will not get paid for this time once they are aware of your departure even though you earned it. Plan accordingly!

★★★★★Current Employee
Vibrent offers an excellent and competitive benefits package. Helping the employees to not worry about too much on their own. Health Benefits are amazing, in addition to PTO and sick leave options, 401K matching is one of the highest in the area. For a small growing company, these benefits are amazing!
Feb 23, 2021
★★★★★Former Project Manager
6% 401k Match is great (after 90 days!) Medical, Vision and Dental benefits on day 1 - approx. $650/month for a family plan out of pocket. Maternity leave is a little weak - 4 weeks paid and then use 6-8 weeks of short-term disability insurance paid out at 60%. PTO is not paid out when you leave, use it or lose it policy. Unlimited sick time.
Oct 21, 2019
★★★★★Current Employee
The benefits are pretty competitive. Health insurance is excellent with a very good company match. You can rollover PTO to the next year, and you get one more week of PTO after 2 years in the company. The company contributes 6% of your salary to 401K, and everyone gets a quarterly bonus. The company also reimburses everybody for their cell phone plan. Everybody gets upto $2000 for continued education

★★★★★Current Data Engineer
Overall benefits are average. PTO and sick time is combined-- I would consider this below industry standard. Lacking benefit is any kind of annual bonus or profit sharing program. The company always is announcing winning more and more business/contracts and it would be nice to have a program as is similar with other software engineering companies. The company culture around work from home is awesome, however, I think due to the lack of the bonus program, there is above average unplanned attrition for talent going to one of the larger companies with a more competitive compensation plan.

Sysco – Why Work With Us
About Us Diversity Benefits Safety Military
The Sysco Story
Building customer relationships requires time, effort and sincerity. For Sysco, it began with a promise to assist foodservice operators in providing consumers with solutions for meals consumed away from home. Since the initial public offering in 1970, when sales were $115 million, Sysco has grown to $60 billion in sales for fiscal year 2019.
Many solid customer relationships have been nurtured along the way, countless dining trends and meal alternatives have evolved, and today the decision to consume meals prepared away from home is as much necessity as choice. Since then, the industry it serves has expanded from $35 billion to approximately $400 billion.
Today, Sysco has sales and service relationships with approximately 625,000 customers and remains committed to helping them succeed in the foodservice industry and satisfy consumers' appetites. Operating from more than 320 locations across the globe, Sysco's product lines are as diverse as the 57,000 associates who support its daily operations. They include not only the ingredients needed to prepare meals, but also numerous ancillary preparation and serving items. As a result, Sysco can make a difference in its customers' lives and the success of their businesses.

★★★★★Former Copywriter
I should mention I was an hourly worker and not eligible for most of Kelly's benefits. HOWEVER, when I was hired, I didn't know that because my lovely recruiter lied to me. That being said: the benefits at Kelly are sub-par even for American standards. The healthcare option has a deductible of $8000. For around the same monthly cost of Kelly's healthcare (IIRC, between $130-$200) your deductible could be $5000. And they don't cover vision or dental. I eventually opted to go to the private marketplace for healthcare. There is no PTO or 401K matching. Kelly's student loan help is a joke. The discounts they offer to all employees from different companies are practically useless.

Shopify – Why Work With Us
About us Shopifolk Culture Careers Work anywhere
The first Shopify store was our own.

More than a decade ago we started an online store to sell snowboard equipment directly to those who loved the sport as much as us.

We could have listed our products on a number of marketplaces, but we wanted to own our brand and build relationships with our customers, along with selling our goods. Such a tool didn’t exist, so we built it for ourselves. We soon realized a number of other stores were in need of a hassle-free platform to build their retail business, and Shopify was born. Since then, it's been our mission to make commerce better for everyone.

We focus on making commerce better for everyone, so businesses can focus on what they do best: building and selling their products. Today, our merchants use our platform to manage every aspect of their business — from products to orders to customers, selling online, in retail stores, and on the go.

The opportunity to shape the future of independent business ownership is in our hands.

Best thing is PTO and sick days. 14 company wide holidays, another 15 paid time off days, 8 paid sick days, and I've never been asked to work a weekend. Honestly nothing a company this size would need to improve on. With under 100 employees in the US, they do a good job keeping costs low for 401k, health, dental, vision, they cover 30k of life insurance for you and you can buy more. Great benefits package for a company this size. They offer both Trad & Roth 401k, and an employer sponsored educational savings account.

★★★★★Current Employee
Best thing is PTO and sick days. 14 company wide holidays, another 15 paid time off days, 8 paid sick days, and I've never been asked to work a weekend. Honestly nothing a company this size would need to improve on. With under 100 employees in the US, they do a good job keeping costs low for 401k, health, dental, vision, they cover 30k of life insurance for you and you can buy more. Great benefits package for a company this size. They offer both Trad & Roth 401k, and an employer sponsored educational savings account.

★★★★★Current Employee
The benefits are unreal-- great health, dental, and vision insurance and the premium is 100% covered. There is also free access to telehealth that includes doctors, behavioral health, dermatology, and dietitians. The life and AD&D insurance is also the best I've seen.
May 5, 2021
★★★★★Current Employee
Remote work is the best thing (but everyone is going remote). No 401k contribution. Buy your own computer. Medical is awful if you have a family. Pay for your own phone, wifi, etc. No added perks besides a meditation app... No vacation time or holidays (even open on Xmas). They say it's discretionary but you really won't get to take time off and if you do, expect to get blown up on Slack and be expected to respond. No time to meditate and no time for self-care.

★★★★★Former Copywriter
I should mention I was an hourly worker and not eligible for most of Kelly's benefits. HOWEVER, when I was hired, I didn't know that because my lovely recruiter lied to me. That being said: the benefits at Kelly are sub-par even for American standards. The healthcare option has a deductible of $8000. For around the same monthly cost of Kelly's healthcare (IIRC, between $130-$200) your deductible could be $5000. And they don't cover vision or dental. I eventually opted to go to the private marketplace for healthcare. There is no PTO or 401K matching. Kelly's student loan help is a joke. The discounts they offer to all employees from different companies are practically useless.

Extend is modernizing the $100 billion-per-year extended warranty and protection plan industry using cutting-edge technology, and top-notch customer service. After a $260M Series C financing round, we are ready to continue to scale our organization and grow beyond our $1.6B valuation.

Our API-first solution allows any merchant to offer extended warranties and protection plans, both online and offline, while also providing a merchant's end customers with a vastly improved and modern support experience that eliminates many of the issues customers face today with legacy underwriters.

We are a venture-backed startup based in downtown San Francisco (and since COVID began, fully remote) that is led by founders who have previously had multiple successful exits. Extend is simplifying the technology stack for the extended warranty industry.

Robert Half – Why Work With Us
Why Robert Half? Benefits Staffing Careers Corporate Careers Inclusion & Diversity Corporate Citizenship
If you like working with people, there’s no better job than one in the staffing industry, particularly with Robert Half. Robert Half is a business, but we view what we do as important in a larger sense, and it’s the basis of our organizational culture — assisting people in finding jobs where they can thrive while helping companies build more engaged and productive teams. Our employees are able not only to pursue a career in an expanding field but also feel good about the work they do.
Robert Half is the world’s first and largest specialized talent solutions firm that connects opportunities at great companies with highly skilled job seekers. We offer contract, temporary and permanent placement solutions for finance and accounting, technology, marketing and creative, legal, and administrative and customer support roles.
Named to Fortune’s World’s Most Admired Companies and 100 Best Companies to Work For® lists and a Forbes Best Employer for Diversity, Robert Half is the parent company of Protiviti®, a global consulting firm that provides internal audit, risk, business and technology consulting solutions.
Robert Half Is a Pioneer
Robert Half helped pioneer specialized staffing services. We were the first business to focus exclusively on the placement of accounting and finance professionals, and later we introduced the concept of the professional-level temporary. Now, professional staffing is the fastest-growing segment in our industry.
Robert Half Is Growing
Our services are consistently in demand. More companies are incorporating contract and temporary professionals into their overall staffing mix to gain flexibility and reduce costs. For firms needing to expand their core workforce, our permanent placement solutions combine cutting-edge recruiting technology with more than seven decades of experience. We also offer our clients remote staffing options — millions of candidates and the right setup so they can work securely from home.
Robert Half Is Constantly Innovating
We have always been innovators. From the moment we invented the professional-level temporary to today’s new tools we give customers to interact with us online, we are constantly looking forward. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are among the latest ways we’re using technology to make better job matches.
Robert Half Is Respected and Stable
Robert Half’s financial position has long been sound and continues to be. We have a long record of producing generous amounts of cash under both favorable and unfavorable business conditions. Many members of our senior management team have been with us for 30 years or more. Robert Half has been repeatedly named to Fortune’s World’s Most Admired Companies and we remain the top-ranked staffing firm (February 2021).
Robert Half Is Invested in YOU
We want our employees to thrive in our company culture and build long careers with us. We are invested in not only getting you started on the right foot but also ensuring your success for years to come.
Targeted onboarding
Don’t worry if you’re not already a staffing expert. The staffing industry is completely new to many of our recruiting professionals when they join us, but our guidance and tools quickly make you comfortable and productive. Our new-hire training includes online and one-on-one coaching to give you just what you’ll need to know to be a success working with us.
Ongoing professional development
Robert Half will continue to support you as you progress in your role. For instance, RHI University, our popular web-based training academy, features more than 8,000 courses, audio seminars and resources in 19 languages to help you build relationships with customers. We also have dedicated training facilities where we host workshops to help you hone your craft.
Advancement opportunities
We have a long tradition of promoting from within. In fact, many of our field executives and managers started in entry-level positions and worked their way up. In addition, when you join Robert Half, a world of opportunity opens to you — literally! We have hundreds of staffing locations across the globe where you can pursue new roles with the company in other cities, states or even countries.

Shopify – Why Work With Us
About us Shopifolk Culture Careers Work anywhere
The first Shopify store was our own.

More than a decade ago we started an online store to sell snowboard equipment directly to those who loved the sport as much as us.

We could have listed our products on a number of marketplaces, but we wanted to own our brand and build relationships with our customers, along with selling our goods. Such a tool didn’t exist, so we built it for ourselves. We soon realized a number of other stores were in need of a hassle-free platform to build their retail business, and Shopify was born. Since then, it's been our mission to make commerce better for everyone.

We focus on making commerce better for everyone, so businesses can focus on what they do best: building and selling their products. Today, our merchants use our platform to manage every aspect of their business — from products to orders to customers, selling online, in retail stores, and on the go.

The opportunity to shape the future of independent business ownership is in our hands.

Logistics Management Institute – Why Work With Us
Why LMI Our Culture Vision & Values Careers Benefits
Come to work, stay to grow.
People come to LMI because they want their work to have meaning and their contributions to have value.
In an industry full of consulting firms, LMI stands apart. Our people and our clients are what matter the most, and our expectation is that each one of our employees plays an active and immediate role in solving our clients’ toughest problems. We hire the bright minds and collaborative spirits needed to get things done, and we support them once they join LMI.
We value openness and inclusion. You’ll see broad diversity of ethnicity, gender, age, and beliefs at all levels of our organization. Our staff is a mix of experienced hires from the private sector, military veterans and spouses, retired federal civilian employees, and recent college graduates.
Our commitment to our clients lies in the ideas and solutions coming from the innovative minds of our people. That value is what has enabled LMI to grow steadily over the past 55 years into the successful and stable organization we are today.
We protect and grow the investments we have made in each hiring decision by offering competitive pay, generous benefits, continuing education opportunities, flexible schedules, performance rewards programs, and a range of rich work-life programs and affinity groups.
Year after year, LMI wins recognition for being a great place to work:
The Washington Post ranked LMI first in the ""Largest Company"" category of its 2021 Top Workplaces in the National Capital Region list.
Recognized as a “Best for Vets” employer by Military Times for ten consecutive years.
Chosen as one of Washington Business Journal’s “Healthiest Employers” in 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011.
Named as one of the Greater Washington area’s “Best Places to Work” for 2013 and 2012 by the Washington Business Journal.
Chosen as one of “Washington’s Great Places to Work” in Washingtonian magazine.
Chosen as a “Military-Friendly Employer” by the Military Officers Association of America, MOAA magazine.
Recipient of The Principal® 10 Best Companies for Employee Financial Security award.
Not surprisingly, over a quarter of our personnel have been with LMI for 10 years or longer, and we have a staff with an average of seven years. And within the last year, approximately one half of our new hires come through employee referrals—a testament to the enthusiasm our employees feel for LMI.

★★★★★Former Copywriter
I should mention I was an hourly worker and not eligible for most of Kelly's benefits. HOWEVER, when I was hired, I didn't know that because my lovely recruiter lied to me. That being said: the benefits at Kelly are sub-par even for American standards. The healthcare option has a deductible of $8000. For around the same monthly cost of Kelly's healthcare (IIRC, between $130-$200) your deductible could be $5000. And they don't cover vision or dental. I eventually opted to go to the private marketplace for healthcare. There is no PTO or 401K matching. Kelly's student loan help is a joke. The discounts they offer to all employees from different companies are practically useless.

Award-Winning Benefits
Employee Ownership Makes a Difference

Torch offers the traditional benefits, such as medical and dental insurance, but other unique benefits as well. Torch provides its employees with a comprehensive set of health care and retirement benefits, one we consider superior to those offered by other companies in the industry. In fact, Torch was recognized by the Principal Financial Group as one of the “The Principal 10 Best Companies for Employee Financial Security” in a national competition of small businesses based on an assessment of company benefit and retirement plans.
Being an employee owned company, we also offer benefits atypical for our industry. For example, Torch provides employees free access to a certified financial planner that includes a series of financial planning-oriented seminars. Employees can borrow up to 40 hours of Paid Time Off, with additional amounts with manager approval. We also allow employees to donate their own Paid Time Off to other employees in times of need. All regular employees are eligible for bonuses each year, and we have a mid-year merit cycle review to provide extra opportunities for pay raises for employees whose salaries warrant adjustment. Additionally, all employees are eligible for Stock Appreciation Rights.

Shopify – Why Work With Us
About us Shopifolk Culture Careers Work anywhere
The first Shopify store was our own.

More than a decade ago we started an online store to sell snowboard equipment directly to those who loved the sport as much as us.

We could have listed our products on a number of marketplaces, but we wanted to own our brand and build relationships with our customers, along with selling our goods. Such a tool didn’t exist, so we built it for ourselves. We soon realized a number of other stores were in need of a hassle-free platform to build their retail business, and Shopify was born. Since then, it's been our mission to make commerce better for everyone.

We focus on making commerce better for everyone, so businesses can focus on what they do best: building and selling their products. Today, our merchants use our platform to manage every aspect of their business — from products to orders to customers, selling online, in retail stores, and on the go.

The opportunity to shape the future of independent business ownership is in our hands.

I should mention I was an hourly worker and not eligible for most of Kelly's benefits. HOWEVER, when I was hired, I didn't know that because my lovely recruiter lied to me. That being said: the benefits at Kelly are sub-par even for American standards. The healthcare option has a deductible of $8000. For around the same monthly cost of Kelly's healthcare (IIRC, between $130-$200) your deductible could be $5000. And they don't cover vision or dental. I eventually opted to go to the private marketplace for healthcare. There is no PTO or 401K matching. Kelly's student loan help is a joke. The discounts they offer to all employees from different companies are practically useless.

★★★★★Former Copywriter
I should mention I was an hourly worker and not eligible for most of Kelly's benefits. HOWEVER, when I was hired, I didn't know that because my lovely recruiter lied to me. That being said: the benefits at Kelly are sub-par even for American standards. The healthcare option has a deductible of $8000. For around the same monthly cost of Kelly's healthcare (IIRC, between $130-$200) your deductible could be $5000. And they don't cover vision or dental. I eventually opted to go to the private marketplace for healthcare. There is no PTO or 401K matching. Kelly's student loan help is a joke. The discounts they offer to all employees from different companies are practically useless.

Employer Summary
Award-Winning Benefits
Employee Ownership Makes a Difference

Torch offers the traditional benefits, such as medical and dental insurance, but other unique benefits as well. Torch provides its employees with a comprehensive set of health care and retirement benefits, one we consider superior to those offered by other companies in the industry. In fact, Torch was recognized by the Principal Financial Group as one of the “The Principal 10 Best Companies for Employee Financial Security” in a national competition of small businesses based on an assessment of company benefit and retirement plans.
Being an employee owned company, we also offer benefits atypical for our industry. For example, Torch provides employees free access to a certified financial planner that includes a series of financial planning-oriented seminars. Employees can borrow up to 40 hours of Paid Time Off, with additional amounts with manager approval. We also allow employees to donate their own Paid Time Off to other employees in times of need. All regular employees are eligible for bonuses each year, and we have a mid-year merit cycle review to provide extra opportunities for pay raises for employees whose salaries warrant adjustment. Additionally, all employees are eligible for Stock Appreciation Rights.

Our new-hire training includes online and one-on-one coaching to give you just what you’ll need to know to be a success working with us.

Health benefits cost is about half of what I have seen with most other employers. And I have a family.
Aug 23, 2017
★★★★★Former Employee
No 401k, no training reimbursement. After the first year of working there and complaining in every single weekly meeting with management that our benefits were terrible compared to the contractors from other companies sitting right next to us (AND NSSPLUS WAS THE PRIME CONTRACT), they finally introduced a 401k.... with 0% matching. They also started offering training reimbursement... only to new employees to encourage fresh meat to come on board. Existing employees got nothing.

Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network and Data Security.
Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, San Francisco, Seattle, Bangalore, London, Melbourne, and Tokyo. Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events (pre and hopefully post-Covid) and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.

Today, there’s more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We need a new perimeter. One that is built in the cloud, and follows and protects data — wherever it goes. One that provides protection without slowing down or creating friction for the business. One that enables fast and secure access to the cloud and web using one of the world’s largest and fastest security networks, so you never have to sacrifice security for performance. This is the new perimeter. This is the Netskope Security Cloud.
Learn from industry luminaries Enrique Salem, Former CEO of Symantec, John Thompson, Chair of the Board for Microsoft, and Mark Anderson, Former President of Palo Alto Networks, on why Netskope is exactly what companies need to secure their users and data in the cloud.

I don't enjoy unlimited PTO I find I take a lot less time off or feel like I can't get away as much. Besides fertility benefits the PPO plan covers everything I've tried to do.

★★★★★Former Copywriter
I should mention I was an hourly worker and not eligible for most of Kelly's benefits. HOWEVER, when I was hired, I didn't know that because my lovely recruiter lied to me. That being said: the benefits at Kelly are sub-par even for American standards. The healthcare option has a deductible of $8000. For around the same monthly cost of Kelly's healthcare (IIRC, between $130-$200) your deductible could be $5000. And they don't cover vision or dental. I eventually opted to go to the private marketplace for healthcare. There is no PTO or 401K matching. Kelly's student loan help is a joke. The discounts they offer to all employees from different companies are practically useless.

★★★★★Former Copywriter
I should mention I was an hourly worker and not eligible for most of Kelly's benefits. HOWEVER, when I was hired, I didn't know that because my lovely recruiter lied to me. That being said: the benefits at Kelly are sub-par even for American standards. The healthcare option has a deductible of $8000. For around the same monthly cost of Kelly's healthcare (IIRC, between $130-$200) your deductible could be $5000. And they don't cover vision or dental. I eventually opted to go to the private marketplace for healthcare. There is no PTO or 401K matching. Kelly's student loan help is a joke. The discounts they offer to all employees from different companies are practically useless.

232,"Senior or Staff Research Scientist, Data Fusion, Automated Mapping Platform (AMP)",$74K - $131K (Glassdoor est.),"Since antiquity, when sea routes and land routes were perilous for people and goods, having up to date and highly accurate maps have been a requirement for safe travel. These maps were patchworks of military sketches, captain logs, and merchant updates, and over the centuries became more and more detailed. In an era of growing vehicle automation, having up-to-date and highly accurate maps is equally critical to ensuring safe vehicle operation both on the highway and on surface roads. Yet map building remains an extensive and highly manual process, meaning real-time high definition map updates often propagate through to the user with a delay of months or years from the date when they were collected, rendering them useless beyond limited driver-assist functions. It is time for a new paradigm.

At TRI, our work is guided by a dedication to safety – in how we research, develop, and validate the performance of vehicle technology to benefit society. As a subsidiary of Toyota, TRI is fueled by a diverse and inclusive community of people who carry invaluable leadership, experience, and ideas from industry-leading companies. Over half of our technical team carries Ph.D. degrees. We’re continually searching for the world’s best talent ‒ people who are ready to define the new world of mobility with us!

Amazon’s mission is to be the most customer centric company in the world. The Workforce Staffing (WFS) organization is on the front line of that mission by hiring the hourly fulfillment associates who make that mission a reality. To drive the necessary growth and continued scale of Amazon’s associate needs within a constrained employment environment, Amazon has created the Workforce Intelligence (WFI) team. This team will (re)invent how Amazon attracts, communicates with, and ultimately hires its hourly associates. This team owns multi-layered research and program implementation to drive deep learning, process improvements, and strategic recommendations to global leadership.
Are you passionate about data? Do you enjoy questioning the status quo? Do complex and difficult challenges excite you? If yes, this may be the team for you.

The Data Scientist - Algorithms will be responsible for creating cutting edge algorithms, predictive and prescriptive models as well as required data models to facilitate WFS at-scale warehouse associate hiring. This role acts as an internal consultant to the Planing and Forecasting (PAF) team covering responsibilities such as at-scale hiring process improvement, analyzing large scale candidate/associate data and being strategic to providing best candidate hiring experience to WFS warehouse associate candidates.

Key Responsibilities
Inclusive Team Culture
Here at Amazon, we embrace our differences. We are committed to furthering our culture of inclusion. We have 12 affinity groups (employee resource groups) with more than 87,000 employees across hundreds of chapters around the world. We have innovative benefit offerings, and host annual and ongoing learning experiences, including our Conversations on Race and Ethnicity (CORE) and AmazeCon (gender diversity) conferences. Amazon’s culture of inclusion is reinforced within our 14 Leadership Principles, which reminds team members to seek diverse perspectives, learn and be curious, and earn trust.

Flexibility
It isn’t about which hours you spend at home or at work; it’s about the flow you establish that brings energy to both parts of your life. We offer flexibility and encourage you to find your own balance between your work and personal lives.

Mentorship & Career Growth
We care about your career growth too. Whether your goals are to explore new technologies, take on bigger opportunities, or get to the next level, we'll help you get there. Our business is growing fast and our people will grow with it.

Amazon is committed to a diverse and inclusive workplace.

Where will Amazon's growth come from in the next year? What about over the next five? Which product lines are poised to quintuple in size? Are we investing enough in our infrastructure, or too much? How do our customers react to changes in prices, product selection, or delivery times?

These are among the most important questions at Amazon today. The Topline Forecast team in the Supply Chain Optimization Technologies (SCOT) organization is dedicated to answering these questions using statistical methods. We develop cutting edge data pipelines, build accurate predictive models, and deploy automated software solutions to provide forecasting insights to business leaders at the most senior levels throughout the company. We are looking for a talented, driven, and analytical researcher to help us answer these (and many more) questions.

This Data Scientist role will design quantitative systems and forecasting models that generate multi-billion dollar predictions of the highest level of visibility and importance for Amazon's financial and operational planning. A successful candidate will be a problem solver who enjoys diving into data, is excited by difficult modeling challenges, and possesses strong communication skills to effectively interface between technical and business teams. As a Data Scientist on the Topline team, you will collaborate directly with economists and statisticians to produce modeling solutions, you will partner with software developers and data engineers to build end-to-end data pipelines and production code, and you will have exposure to senior leadership as we communicate results and provide scientific guidance to the business.

Award-Winning Benefits
Employee Ownership Makes a Difference

Torch offers the traditional benefits, such as medical and dental insurance, but other unique benefits as well. Torch provides its employees with a comprehensive set of health care and retirement benefits, one we consider superior to those offered by other companies in the industry. In fact, Torch was recognized by the Principal Financial Group as one of the “The Principal 10 Best Companies for Employee Financial Security” in a national competition of small businesses based on an assessment of company benefit and retirement plans.
Being an employee owned company, we also offer benefits atypical for our industry. For example, Torch provides employees free access to a certified financial planner that includes a series of financial planning-oriented seminars. Employees can borrow up to 40 hours of Paid Time Off, with additional amounts with manager approval. We also allow employees to donate their own Paid Time Off to other employees in times of need. All regular employees are eligible for bonuses each year, and we have a mid-year merit cycle review to provide extra opportunities for pay raises for employees whose salaries warrant adjustment. Additionally, all employees are eligible for Stock Appreciation Rights.

We conduct research and development, manage laboratories, design and manufacture products, and deliver critical services for our clients – whether you are a multi-national corporation, a small start-up organization or a government agency. We are valued for our independence and ability to innovate.
Our Vision, Mission & Values
Battelle's vision is to be a major force in science and technology discovery and in the translation of knowledge into innovative applications that have significant societal and economic impacts. Steel industrialist Gordon Battelle provided for the Battelle Memorial Institute in his 1923 last will and testament after a career devoted to the idea that science and research can solve problems in business and society as a whole. His vision became our mission when we opened our doors six years later.
Our Solvers
At Battelle, we consider ourselves very fortunate to have some of the brightest and most creative minds walking our hallways and working in our labs. Our employees – called “Solvers” for the solutions they provide to difficult challenges – are the glue that holds our company together and why we’re still here after more than 85 years.

Health Insurance (32 comments)
""Absolutely awful, thinking that working for a healthcare company you would have amazing insurance coverage. Expect to pay thousands of dollars in deductibles prior to your insurance coverage paying a dime and if you have family and want to add them it's very costly. Expect to pay hundreds of dollars a month for very bad coverage.""
401K Plan (22 comments)
""They match up to 6% and it is a good package ""
Vacation & Paid Time Off (19 comments)
""It's standard, I believe 24-28 days a year, this includes sick time. It's all lumped under PTO.""
Aug 19, 2021
★★★★★Former Employee
The company benefits package is good.

★★★★★Current Licensed Clinical Social Worker
We have a great salary, 401k match and benefits are pricey but very good.
Aug 17, 2021
★★★★★Current Care Manager
- Ironically insurance coverage is extremely expensive. Even at the top tiers expect to spend thousands of dollars in deductibles prior to having coverage. At the lower tier expect to have more than 5,000 dollars in deductibles prior to the insurance paying anything. This also goes for PREVENTATIVE care except for two women GYN check up visits per year, so even going to see your PCP you have to pay out of pocket for. - Negative: you have to work from 8:30-5 with a 30 minute lunch break. If you want a hour lunch break, your work day is 9 hours long. What's the point of working from home? - They match 401K up to a certain amount after one year, I forget the percentage. - Prior to federal holidays you leave work at 3:00PM. However this can be taken away and is many times threatened to not be issued if you are not up to date on your work.

★★★★★Former Copywriter
I should mention I was an hourly worker and not eligible for most of Kelly's benefits. HOWEVER, when I was hired, I didn't know that because my lovely recruiter lied to me. That being said: the benefits at Kelly are sub-par even for American standards. The healthcare option has a deductible of $8000. For around the same monthly cost of Kelly's healthcare (IIRC, between $130-$200) your deductible could be $5000. And they don't cover vision or dental. I eventually opted to go to the private marketplace for healthcare. There is no PTO or 401K matching. Kelly's student loan help is a joke. The discounts they offer to all employees from different companies are practically useless.

North Highland – Why Work With Us
Our Story Inclusion & Diversity Culture Working Here Giving Back
It’s incredible to think about how far North Highland has come. What started out as a kitchen table and three computers is now a world-leading consultancy firm…
After years of consulting experience, in 1992, our founders decided it was time for a change. Consultancy needed to be less about long hours and spiraling quotes. Instead, it needed more compassion. More collaboration with clients. So North Highland was born.
From the get-go, we’ve put people at the heart of everything. And today, that’s still intact. We make change happen together. No one could’ve predicted how large our impact would become. With offices spanning North America, South Africa, and the UK—we’ve transformed countless organizations from the inside out. As a member of Cordence Worldwide, we’re diverse thinking in action.
This book explains our vision, motivation, voice, and desired behaviors, so that you have confidence representing North Highland, and adding to our growth story

★★★★★Current Customer Service Representative (CSR)
For benefit brokers, you would think they could do better. High deductibles, high coinsurances, cost transferred to employees, no local benefits help for employees, no human contact at headquarters for assistance. Middle man directed programs that are hard to navigate and provide poor results. 401match is low. PTO laughable - if you take off you make up the time when you get back

Qualtrics – Why Work With Us
About Us Meet Our Teams Offices Life At Qualtrics Benefits
We’re all about experiences, but none are as important to us as the ones we provide to our employees.
After all, our employees engineer, sell, market, and support the Experience Management Platform around the world. Our software is only as strong as our collective will to improve every day.
It’s why we use our platform to run regular employee surveys—and follow up on the results with immediate action.
Why we hold an all-hands meeting every week—with live participation from our offices around the globe.
Why our board members are more apt to share information than to hoard it.
Why our CEO works from a standing desk next to our creative team.
Why our benefits packages and workspaces are always subject to revision—but only for the better.
Our employees are why we’re here—and we never forget that.

Employer Summary
TOTAL REWARDS
The term “benefits” doesn’t really do our employee rewards program justice. We provide medical, dental, and vision insurance, 20+ days of annual leave, generous retirement fund contributions, company equity, quarterly bonuses, and tons of career mobility.
WORK HARD/PLAY HARD
For every bit of hard work we put in, we have twice the fun. Whether that means taking a break in a massage chair or hitting the slopes after work, Qualtrics makes sure that employees take time to recharge and live it up.

UPWARD MOBILITY
Because we’re a hyper-growth company, getting promoted and taking on more opportunity is always an option. We hire individuals who have what it takes to quickly step into the next role and take on opportunities beyond their core job description.

OFFICE PERKS
We believe in a workspace that allows you to take a breather and pepper fun throughout your day. Grab a beer in the Dublin office pub, enjoy Seattle’s rooftop patio overlooking the Puget Sound, or raid one of the many kitchens around Provo’s office.

HIGH BAR
We’re looking for top performers with a wide array of professional and personal experience. Our employees are driven, intelligent, diverse and interesting people who work well in teams and know how to have fun.

GLOBAL
Qualtrics employees are plugged into a network of experienced professionals around the globe. With weekly company-wide video meetings and our own internal social network, employees get global experience and stay up-to-date on what’s happening across the organization.

Schneider – Why Work With Us
About Us Office Diesel Technician Warehouse Driver
Schneider delivers
Schneider hauls freight and lots of it. In fact, our drivers move nearly 11,000 loads each day. We carry merchandise and materials for two-thirds of the Fortune 500 companies – meaning we have a direct impact on the economy. If our trucks stopped moving, the loads wouldn’t be delivered, and if you went to the store to pick something up, chances are it wouldn’t be there. Bottom line: We keep the country moving and deliver the standard of living you’ve come to expect.
How we operate
Schneider is built to last. We remain stable and strong because we conduct our business with the utmost respect for our associates, our customers and the world around us.
 We offer all associates competitive pay and comprehensive benefits, challenge them to follow career paths that are exciting and celebrate their victories with them.
We promise our customers honesty, integrity and an unwavering commitment to get the job done right.
We respect the world around us by operating in an environmentally-friendly manner. We are continually striving to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel efficiency.
We know the importance of our number-one core value: safety first and always. Nothing we do is worth hurting ourselves or others.
Schneider is an equal opportunity employer.  
Schneider is proud to be ISO 9002 certified. ISO 9000 is a series of international standards for quality assurance systems. This means Schneider is officially considered a world-class organization.

MITRE has a 403B - which is like a 401K for non-profits. There is no company contribution to the 403B during an employee's first year. Once an emp reaches their 1 year mark: If they contribute the maximum allowed by SS, the company match is equivalent to 10% of the base salary. It gets even better - there is no vesting schedule. As soon as the company contribution hit's the paycheck - that money is 100% vested!

★★★★★Current Employee
MITRE has a 403B - which is like a 401K for non-profits. There is no company contribution to the 403B during an employee's first year. Once an emp reaches their 1 year mark: If they contribute the maximum allowed by SS, the company match is equivalent to 10% of the base salary. It gets even better - there is no vesting schedule. As soon as the company contribution hit's the paycheck - that money is 100% vested!

I should mention I was an hourly worker and not eligible for most of Kelly's benefits. HOWEVER, when I was hired, I didn't know that because my lovely recruiter lied to me. That being said: the benefits at Kelly are sub-par even for American standards. The healthcare option has a deductible of $8000. For around the same monthly cost of Kelly's healthcare (IIRC, between $130-$200) your deductible could be $5000. And they don't cover vision or dental. I eventually opted to go to the private marketplace for healthcare. There is no PTO or 401K matching. Kelly's student loan help is a joke. The discounts they offer to all employees from different companies are practically useless.

We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network and Data Security.
Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, San Francisco, Seattle, Bangalore, London, Melbourne, and Tokyo. Our core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration, and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events (pre and hopefully post-Covid) and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.

About Us Our Leadership Our Culture Join #TeamNetskope How It Works
We're Redefining Cloud, Network, and Data Security
Today, there’s more data and users outside the enterprise than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to dissolve. We need a new perimeter. One that is built in the cloud, and follows and protects data — wherever it goes. One that provides protection without slowing down or creating friction for the business. One that enables fast and secure access to the cloud and web using one of the world’s largest and fastest security networks, so you never have to sacrifice security for performance. This is the new perimeter. This is the Netskope Security Cloud.
Learn from industry luminaries Enrique Salem, Former CEO of Symantec, John Thompson, Chair of the Board for Microsoft, and Mark Anderson, Former President of Palo Alto Networks, on why Netskope is exactly what companies need to secure their users and data in the cloud.

CommonSpirit Health – Why Work With Us
About Us Philanthropy What We Do
The result of years of planning, CommonSpirit was created by the alignment of Catholic Health Initiatives and Dignity Health as a single ministry in early 2019.
Our commitment to serve the common good is delivered through the dedicated work of thousands of physicians, advanced practice clinicians, nurses, and staff; through clinical excellence delivered across a system of hospitals and other care centers covering 21 states, and accessible to nearly one in four U.S. residents; and through more than $4 billion annually in charity care, community benefits, and government program services.
Our calling is in our name.
The CommonSpirit name was inspired by scripture: “Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good” (1 Corinthians 12:7 NIV). Those words motivate and guide us every day. They celebrate the healing gift of compassion that God gives to us all, and they remind us of our calling to serve the common good.
“Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.”

★★★★★Former Copywriter
I should mention I was an hourly worker and not eligible for most of Kelly's benefits. HOWEVER, when I was hired, I didn't know that because my lovely recruiter lied to me. That being said: the benefits at Kelly are sub-par even for American standards. The healthcare option has a deductible of $8000. For around the same monthly cost of Kelly's healthcare (IIRC, between $130-$200) your deductible could be $5000. And they don't cover vision or dental. I eventually opted to go to the private marketplace for healthcare. There is no PTO or 401K matching. Kelly's student loan help is a joke. The discounts they offer to all employees from different companies are practically useless.

★★★★★Former Copywriter
I should mention I was an hourly worker and not eligible for most of Kelly's benefits. HOWEVER, when I was hired, I didn't know that because my lovely recruiter lied to me. That being said: the benefits at Kelly are sub-par even for American standards. The healthcare option has a deductible of $8000. For around the same monthly cost of Kelly's healthcare (IIRC, between $130-$200) your deductible could be $5000. And they don't cover vision or dental. I eventually opted to go to the private marketplace for healthcare. There is no PTO or 401K matching. Kelly's student loan help is a joke. The discounts they offer to all employees from different companies are practically useless.

Personal time off is combined with sick leave. 10hrs/mo, appx 3 weeks a year. 401k is matched up to 3.5% of gross income. There is up to a $50/mo gym membership reimbursement that is distributed twice a year in a lump sum based on your membership receipts. There is a small pretax travel expense adjustment that you can register for, but do direct reimbursement for parking or transit expenses. Education benefits are minimal but due to the small company culture, often employees can make case-by-case arrangements with the senior leadership depending on their situation.

497,"Senior or Staff Research Scientist, Data Fusion, Automated Mapping Platform (AMP)",$54K - $110K (Glassdoor est.),"Since antiquity, when sea routes and land routes were perilous for people and goods, having up to date and highly accurate maps have been a requirement for safe travel. These maps were patchworks of military sketches, captain logs, and merchant updates, and over the centuries became more and more detailed. In an era of growing vehicle automation, having up-to-date and highly accurate maps is equally critical to ensuring safe vehicle operation both on the highway and on surface roads. Yet map building remains an extensive and highly manual process, meaning real-time high definition map updates often propagate through to the user with a delay of months or years from the date when they were collected, rendering them useless beyond limited driver-assist functions. It is time for a new paradigm.

At TRI, our work is guided by a dedication to safety – in how we research, develop, and validate the performance of vehicle technology to benefit society. As a subsidiary of Toyota, TRI is fueled by a diverse and inclusive community of people who carry invaluable leadership, experience, and ideas from industry-leading companies. Over half of our technical team carries Ph.D. degrees. We’re continually searching for the world’s best talent ‒ people who are ready to define the new world of mobility with us!

I should mention I was an hourly worker and not eligible for most of Kelly's benefits. HOWEVER, when I was hired, I didn't know that because my lovely recruiter lied to me. That being said: the benefits at Kelly are sub-par even for American standards. The healthcare option has a deductible of $8000. For around the same monthly cost of Kelly's healthcare (IIRC, between $130-$200) your deductible could be $5000. And they don't cover vision or dental. I eventually opted to go to the private marketplace for healthcare. There is no PTO or 401K matching. Kelly's student loan help is a joke. The discounts they offer to all employees from different companies are practically useless.

I should mention I was an hourly worker and not eligible for most of Kelly's benefits. HOWEVER, when I was hired, I didn't know that because my lovely recruiter lied to me. That being said: the benefits at Kelly are sub-par even for American standards. The healthcare option has a deductible of $8000. For around the same monthly cost of Kelly's healthcare (IIRC, between $130-$200) your deductible could be $5000. And they don't cover vision or dental. I eventually opted to go to the private marketplace for healthcare. There is no PTO or 401K matching. Kelly's student loan help is a joke. The discounts they offer to all employees from different companies are practically useless.

★★★★★Former Copywriter
I should mention I was an hourly worker and not eligible for most of Kelly's benefits. HOWEVER, when I was hired, I didn't know that because my lovely recruiter lied to me. That being said: the benefits at Kelly are sub-par even for American standards. The healthcare option has a deductible of $8000. For around the same monthly cost of Kelly's healthcare (IIRC, between $130-$200) your deductible could be $5000. And they don't cover vision or dental. I eventually opted to go to the private marketplace for healthcare. There is no PTO or 401K matching. Kelly's student loan help is a joke. The discounts they offer to all employees from different companies are practically useless.

Award-Winning Benefits
Employee Ownership Makes a Difference

Torch offers the traditional benefits, such as medical and dental insurance, but other unique benefits as well. Torch provides its employees with a comprehensive set of health care and retirement benefits, one we consider superior to those offered by other companies in the industry. In fact, Torch was recognized by the Principal Financial Group as one of the “The Principal 10 Best Companies for Employee Financial Security” in a national competition of small businesses based on an assessment of company benefit and retirement plans.
Being an employee owned company, we also offer benefits atypical for our industry. For example, Torch provides employees free access to a certified financial planner that includes a series of financial planning-oriented seminars. Employees can borrow up to 40 hours of Paid Time Off, with additional amounts with manager approval. We also allow employees to donate their own Paid Time Off to other employees in times of need. All regular employees are eligible for bonuses each year, and we have a mid-year merit cycle review to provide extra opportunities for pay raises for employees whose salaries warrant adjustment. Additionally, all employees are eligible for Stock Appreciation Rights.

North Highland – Why Work With Us
Our Story Inclusion & Diversity Culture Working Here Giving Back
It’s incredible to think about how far North Highland has come. What started out as a kitchen table and three computers is now a world-leading consultancy firm…
After years of consulting experience, in 1992, our founders decided it was time for a change. Consultancy needed to be less about long hours and spiraling quotes. Instead, it needed more compassion. More collaboration with clients. So North Highland was born.
From the get-go, we’ve put people at the heart of everything. And today, that’s still intact. We make change happen together. No one could’ve predicted how large our impact would become. With offices spanning North America, South Africa, and the UK—we’ve transformed countless organizations from the inside out. As a member of Cordence Worldwide, we’re diverse thinking in action.
This book explains our vision, motivation, voice, and desired behaviors, so that you have confidence representing North Highland, and adding to our growth story

""Time Off is joke. They have got Flexible Time off , so they don't have to pay you for all the unused PTO. Any time off count against your utilization ""

Decent benefits overall for employees, the best one being unlimited PTO.
Jul 17, 2021
★★★★★Former Employee
Unlimited PTO just means they dont have to pay you out if you leave for unused time, and no protected time outside your utilization. Forget time off during a project - you won't hit utilization and you won't get a bonus

Our team of scientists, technologists, and academics looks beyond traditional methods to develop creative solutions to some of the world’s most complex economic problems.

We are seeking a data scientist to join our growing team and contribute to developing real-time views of consumer and sector-level microeconomic behavior and insights into how that collective behavior manifests in the global economy. We use large-scale real-world observational data to observe and contextualize macroeconomic conditions, regional economic health, consumer decision making, and sector- and firm-level performance in order to drive investment strategies. We often work with semi- or unstructured data sets, and need to be comfortable getting deep into messy data to design, test, and implement economically-intuitive features that measure real world economic activity. To accomplish this, we work closely with our partners to identify, develop, and monetize differentiated hypothesis-driven features that provide a real-time lens on emerging economic and commercial trends.

TOTAL REWARDS
The term “benefits” doesn’t really do our employee rewards program justice. We provide medical, dental, and vision insurance, 20+ days of annual leave, generous retirement fund contributions, company equity, quarterly bonuses, and tons of career mobility.
WORK HARD/PLAY HARD
For every bit of hard work we put in, we have twice the fun. Whether that means taking a break in a massage chair or hitting the slopes after work, Qualtrics makes sure that employees take time to recharge and live it up.

UPWARD MOBILITY
Because we’re a hyper-growth company, getting promoted and taking on more opportunity is always an option. We hire individuals who have what it takes to quickly step into the next role and take on opportunities beyond their core job description.

OFFICE PERKS
We believe in a workspace that allows you to take a breather and pepper fun throughout your day. Grab a beer in the Dublin office pub, enjoy Seattle’s rooftop patio overlooking the Puget Sound, or raid one of the many kitchens around Provo’s office.

HIGH BAR
We’re looking for top performers with a wide array of professional and personal experience. Our employees are driven, intelligent, diverse and interesting people who work well in teams and know how to have fun.

GLOBAL
Qualtrics employees are plugged into a network of experienced professionals around the globe. With weekly company-wide video meetings and our own internal social network, employees get global experience and stay up-to-date on what’s happening across the organization.

North American Bancard – Why Work With Us
COVID-19 Response Life@NAB Our Culture Our Philosophy Why Work For Us
Below are some exciting actions we have taken to transform the way we work at NAB!
To promote safety and well being we’re actively conducting all interviews and new hire orientation and onboarding by video and published a best-in-class “Safe Work Playbook” based on guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization. The playbook lays out processes and protocols to ensure all team members stay  safe, healthy and productive during this unprecedented time.. 
All training that can be done remotely - is being conducted virtually!
Due to popular demand, we revamped our “Moments of Magic” peer-to-peer recognition program and consistently celebrate team members who create MAGIC for others - virtually!
We are actively seeking input and feedback from our team members through company wide surveys, focus groups and 1:1 interviews. Based on team member feedback we:
Determined that everyone who can, will continue to work remotely until at least the end of 2020. 
Partnered with Staples and now offer $250 merchandise credit to all remote team members allowing them to purchase ergonomic furniture and new technology to help upgrade their remote work environment...keeping them safe, healthy and productive.
Implemented training specifically targeted to helping our leaders to lead and motivate remote teams.
Reinvigorated our wellness program and added “Emotional Wellbeing” as a component based on our team members’ feedback.
Held focus groups with  NAB parents to determine how we could better support them during this uncertain school year.
We asked leaders to meet one-on-one with each direct report to discuss what challenges and stressors they’re facing, and how we might be able to help with flexibility in their work schedule.
Plan to implement a technology reimbursement program to cover a portion of internet and cell phone expenses to support remote team members.
Conducting monthly leader town hall meetings with transparent business updates from the executive team to cascade communication throughout the organization.
Most importantly...to date we celebrate the fact we have experienced ZERO business related COVID-19 cases across the country!  We believe this is due to all of the actions that prioritized the health and safety of our valued team members including our stringent cleaning protocols and policies governing those who work in shared spaces.
Through this pandemic, our leaders have continued to prioritize - through words and actions - the high value we place on our team members.  Our focus going forward is to drive collaboration, continuous improvement, and innovation allowing us to stay committed to our success and the success of the merchants we serve. As a team-we can accomplish anything! #lifeatnab

Novelis Purpose Careers at Novelis Our Culture Sustainability Community
  To go somewhere new, you must be willing to move. That’s what two men did when they launched our industry in the late 1800s. We continue to follow in their footsteps, recasting what it means to be an aluminum company – by getting away from mining and smelting and redefining ourselves through recycling. These bold, pioneering moves have become a movement. And, as the largest recycler of aluminum in the world, we are its leaders. 
At Novelis, we make more than aluminum. We make it into something new. Extend what it can be. We give it the lightness to amaze. The flexibility to perform. The strength to protect. How we do this is as much about human chemistry as it is metallurgy. It starts with forming a foundation of care, respect and trust. Then opening a space for creativity. A place to listen and share ideas. Where thinking gets stretched, limits get pushed and infinite discoveries can be made. 

  We win by shaping partnerships inside the company and around the globe. Because lasting innovation doesn’t happen alone. This ability to think big and act bold is at our core. It’s how our breakthroughs happen. It’s how we brought one of the first all-aluminum vehicle bodies to the automotive industry. How we had the forward focus to rethink sustainability by leveraging collective cooperation to turn customers of advanced materials into suppliers of raw material. 
For us, the difference between good and great comes down to our employees – pioneering, providing, protecting. Proud, yet humble strivers, driving transformation by balancing what we do now with what we’re capable of in the future. Exceptional people who are committed to extending the capabilities of our customers. Supplying them the inspiration to invent, the ability to solve, the means to move, and the material to shape a more sustainable world together.

Robert Half Is a Pioneer
Robert Half helped pioneer specialized staffing services. We were the first business to focus exclusively on the placement of accounting and finance professionals, and later we introduced the concept of the professional-level temporary. Now, professional staffing is the fastest-growing segment in our industry.
Robert Half Is Growing
Our services are consistently in demand. More companies are incorporating contract and temporary professionals into their overall staffing mix to gain flexibility and reduce costs. For firms needing to expand their core workforce, our permanent placement solutions combine cutting-edge recruiting technology with more than seven decades of experience. We also offer our clients remote staffing options — millions of candidates and the right setup so they can work securely from home.
Robert Half Is Constantly Innovating
We have always been innovators. From the moment we invented the professional-level temporary to today’s new tools we give customers to interact with us online, we are constantly looking forward. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are among the latest ways we’re using technology to make better job matches.
Robert Half Is Respected and Stable
Robert Half’s financial position has long been sound and continues to be. We have a long record of producing generous amounts of cash under both favorable and unfavorable business conditions. Many members of our senior management team have been with us for 30 years or more. Robert Half has been repeatedly named to Fortune’s World’s Most Admired Companies and we remain the top-ranked staffing firm (February 2021).
Robert Half Is Invested in YOU
We want our employees to thrive in our company culture and build long careers with us. We are invested in not only getting you started on the right foot but also ensuring your success for years to come.
Targeted onboarding

★★★★★Former Copywriter
I should mention I was an hourly worker and not eligible for most of Kelly's benefits. HOWEVER, when I was hired, I didn't know that because my lovely recruiter lied to me. That being said: the benefits at Kelly are sub-par even for American standards. The healthcare option has a deductible of $8000. For around the same monthly cost of Kelly's healthcare (IIRC, between $130-$200) your deductible could be $5000. And they don't cover vision or dental. I eventually opted to go to the private marketplace for healthcare. There is no PTO or 401K matching. Kelly's student loan help is a joke. The discounts they offer to all employees from different companies are practically useless.

Rivian Automotive – Why Work With Us
Company Locations
We Are Rivian
Starting from a clean sheet has allowed us to learn from and leverage what’s been done in the past while giving us the freedom to reimagine mobility from the ground up. Our vehicles and technology are designed and engineered to challenge what’s possible and to inspire people to explore the world in new ways.
We believe in the power of adventure. Science and invention depend on our innate curiosity and desire to explore the unknown. While a vehicle can’t make someone adventurous, it can nurture that fundamental desire in each of us to go places we’ve never been and do things we’ve never done — thoughtfully and sustainably.
Our development centers are located in Plymouth, MI, San Jose, CA, Irvine, CA and Surrey, England. In addition to these four locations, we have a modern manufacturing facility in Normal, IL and will begin production of our R1T and R1S in 2020. 
  The Adventure Is Just Beginning
Doing something different is never easy. It requires courage, optimism and grit. Core to delivering on our vision is building a team of curious individuals, determined to make a positive impact on the world. This means challenging ourselves, stretching beyond the bounds of conventional thinking, reframing old problems, seeking new solutions and operating comfortably in a space of uncertainty. 
Our team has a diverse set of backgrounds— but at heart, we are adventurers on a mission to move the world in a new direction. We’re currently looking for thinkers and doers with a strong sense of adventure to join us on this journey.

Logistics Management Institute – Why Work With Us
Why LMI Our Culture Vision & Values Careers Benefits
Come to work, stay to grow.
People come to LMI because they want their work to have meaning and their contributions to have value.
In an industry full of consulting firms, LMI stands apart. Our people and our clients are what matter the most, and our expectation is that each one of our employees plays an active and immediate role in solving our clients’ toughest problems. We hire the bright minds and collaborative spirits needed to get things done, and we support them once they join LMI.
We value openness and inclusion. You’ll see broad diversity of ethnicity, gender, age, and beliefs at all levels of our organization. Our staff is a mix of experienced hires from the private sector, military veterans and spouses, retired federal civilian employees, and recent college graduates.
Our commitment to our clients lies in the ideas and solutions coming from the innovative minds of our people. That value is what has enabled LMI to grow steadily over the past 55 years into the successful and stable organization we are today.
We protect and grow the investments we have made in each hiring decision by offering competitive pay, generous benefits, continuing education opportunities, flexible schedules, performance rewards programs, and a range of rich work-life programs and affinity groups.
Year after year, LMI wins recognition for being a great place to work:
The Washington Post ranked LMI first in the ""Largest Company"" category of its 2021 Top Workplaces in the National Capital Region list.
Recognized as a “Best for Vets” employer by Military Times for ten consecutive years.
Chosen as one of Washington Business Journal’s “Healthiest Employers” in 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011.
Named as one of the Greater Washington area’s “Best Places to Work” for 2013 and 2012 by the Washington Business Journal.
Chosen as one of “Washington’s Great Places to Work” in Washingtonian magazine.
Chosen as a “Military-Friendly Employer” by the Military Officers Association of America, MOAA magazine.
Recipient of The Principal® 10 Best Companies for Employee Financial Security award.
Not surprisingly, over a quarter of our personnel have been with LMI for 10 years or longer, and we have a staff with an average of seven years. And within the last year, approximately one half of our new hires come through employee referrals—a testament to the enthusiasm our employees feel for LMI.

Logistics Management Institute – Why Work With Us
Why LMI Our Culture Vision & Values Careers Benefits
Come to work, stay to grow.
People come to LMI because they want their work to have meaning and their contributions to have value.
In an industry full of consulting firms, LMI stands apart. Our people and our clients are what matter the most, and our expectation is that each one of our employees plays an active and immediate role in solving our clients’ toughest problems. We hire the bright minds and collaborative spirits needed to get things done, and we support them once they join LMI.
We value openness and inclusion. You’ll see broad diversity of ethnicity, gender, age, and beliefs at all levels of our organization. Our staff is a mix of experienced hires from the private sector, military veterans and spouses, retired federal civilian employees, and recent college graduates.
Our commitment to our clients lies in the ideas and solutions coming from the innovative minds of our people. That value is what has enabled LMI to grow steadily over the past 55 years into the successful and stable organization we are today.
We protect and grow the investments we have made in each hiring decision by offering competitive pay, generous benefits, continuing education opportunities, flexible schedules, performance rewards programs, and a range of rich work-life programs and affinity groups.
Year after year, LMI wins recognition for being a great place to work:
The Washington Post ranked LMI first in the ""Largest Company"" category of its 2021 Top Workplaces in the National Capital Region list.
Recognized as a “Best for Vets” employer by Military Times for ten consecutive years.
Chosen as one of Washington Business Journal’s “Healthiest Employers” in 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011.
Named as one of the Greater Washington area’s “Best Places to Work” for 2013 and 2012 by the Washington Business Journal.
Chosen as one of “Washington’s Great Places to Work” in Washingtonian magazine.
Chosen as a “Military-Friendly Employer” by the Military Officers Association of America, MOAA magazine.
Recipient of The Principal® 10 Best Companies for Employee Financial Security award.

""While BMC Software offers a couple of weeks off, any time off you take counts against your performance and your management will exploit this whenever they can. Of course if you are management then that’s not the case but still time off is a poor plan.""

Robert Half – Why Work With Us
Why Robert Half? Benefits Staffing Careers Corporate Careers Inclusion & Diversity Corporate Citizenship
If you like working with people, there’s no better job than one in the staffing industry, particularly with Robert Half. Robert Half is a business, but we view what we do as important in a larger sense, and it’s the basis of our organizational culture — assisting people in finding jobs where they can thrive while helping companies build more engaged and productive teams. Our employees are able not only to pursue a career in an expanding field but also feel good about the work they do.
Robert Half is the world’s first and largest specialized talent solutions firm that connects opportunities at great companies with highly skilled job seekers. We offer contract, temporary and permanent placement solutions for finance and accounting, technology, marketing and creative, legal, and administrative and customer support roles.
Named to Fortune’s World’s Most Admired Companies and 100 Best Companies to Work For® lists and a Forbes Best Employer for Diversity, Robert Half is the parent company of Protiviti®, a global consulting firm that provides internal audit, risk, business and technology consulting solutions.
Robert Half Is a Pioneer
Robert Half helped pioneer specialized staffing services. We were the first business to focus exclusively on the placement of accounting and finance professionals, and later we introduced the concept of the professional-level temporary. Now, professional staffing is the fastest-growing segment in our industry.
Robert Half Is Growing
Our services are consistently in demand. More companies are incorporating contract and temporary professionals into their overall staffing mix to gain flexibility and reduce costs. For firms needing to expand their core workforce, our permanent placement solutions combine cutting-edge recruiting technology with more than seven decades of experience. We also offer our clients remote staffing options — millions of candidates and the right setup so they can work securely from home.
Robert Half Is Constantly Innovating
We have always been innovators. From the moment we invented the professional-level temporary to today’s new tools we give customers to interact with us online, we are constantly looking forward. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are among the latest ways we’re using technology to make better job matches.
Robert Half Is Respected and Stable
Robert Half’s financial position has long been sound and continues to be. We have a long record of producing generous amounts of cash under both favorable and unfavorable business conditions. Many members of our senior management team have been with us for 30 years or more. Robert Half has been repeatedly named to Fortune’s World’s Most Admired Companies and we remain the top-ranked staffing firm (February 2021).
Robert Half Is Invested in YOU
We want our employees to thrive in our company culture and build long careers with us. We are invested in not only getting you started on the right foot but also ensuring your success for years to come.
Targeted onboarding
Don’t worry if you’re not already a staffing expert. The staffing industry is completely new to many of our recruiting professionals when they join us, but our guidance and tools quickly make you comfortable and productive. Our new-hire training includes online and one-on-one coaching to give you just what you’ll need to know to be a success working with us.
Ongoing professional development
Robert Half will continue to support you as you progress in your role. For instance, RHI University, our popular web-based training academy, features more than 8,000 courses, audio seminars and resources in 19 languages to help you build relationships with customers. We also have dedicated training facilities where we host workshops to help you hone your craft.
Advancement opportunities
We have a long tradition of promoting from within. In fact, many of our field executives and managers started in entry-level positions and worked their way up. In addition, when you join Robert Half, a world of opportunity opens to you — literally! We have hundreds of staffing locations across the globe where you can pursue new roles with the company in other cities, states or even countries.

★★★★★Former Copywriter
I should mention I was an hourly worker and not eligible for most of Kelly's benefits. HOWEVER, when I was hired, I didn't know that because my lovely recruiter lied to me. That being said: the benefits at Kelly are sub-par even for American standards. The healthcare option has a deductible of $8000. For around the same monthly cost of Kelly's healthcare (IIRC, between $130-$200) your deductible could be $5000. And they don't cover vision or dental. I eventually opted to go to the private marketplace for healthcare. There is no PTO or 401K matching. Kelly's student loan help is a joke. The discounts they offer to all employees from different companies are practically useless.

You can only use sick time if you have Pto. They give penny raises. They expect you to do multiple job functions for the price of one. This is more of a work one to two year job and then leave. There is no growth here and they don’t care about their employees. All the great benefits they once had have been stripped away so there’s only micromanaging and high expectations left. 401k no longer has company matching. They say we’re doing great but took away our incentives. You can call out 5 times (5 days) 6th or 7th day is now termination. They don’t take doctors notes so that won’t help. The benefits below are offered through your own payment plans, you pick and choose your deductibles and how much money comes out per paycheck.

Computercraft is seeking a biologist with a background in human clinical or animal model phenotype data. The successful candidate will curate clinical phenotype data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database on Genotype and Phenotype (dbGaP), accessible online at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap. Our scientists work at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, MD, in a production-oriented, rather than research-oriented, environment.
dbGaP was developed to archive and distribute the data and results from studies investigating the interaction of genotype and phenotype in humans to assist scientists in discovering associations between genetic variants and risks for disease. Responsibilities of the Scientific Data Curator will include data quality control and curation, annotation and integration of study metadata (study protocols and data collection forms), and communication with external investigators. Candidates require the organizational and managerial skills to see a study through the process of original submission, internal processing, quality testing, and public deployment. This is an opportunity to be involved in the advancement of a high-profile resource that is working to revolutionize human genetic disease research.

Description:
Join our client's NL AI team where you'll be assembling natural language fairness test sets. As we work to provide ethical and responsible AI services, we have to create metrics for fairness risks inherent to each scenario. You will be working with the Responsible AI group to assemble two fairness test sets for email Suggested Replies models (covering two separate demographic factors like gender, religion, etc).
Fairness in natural language services is a sociotechnical problem, so we have to carefully create our fairness metrics with techniques informed by social sciences and linguistics. We also want to maximize the impact of the work you do, by making sure resulting resources are applicable to other similar AI products. These two goals inform the exact approach you'll be taking in your day-to-day.
You will be expected to deliver two fairness test sets, with approval from the product group and the Responsible AI group, complete with documentation and clear references to components you used to assemble the datasets. To achieve this goal, you'll follow a process that has been created and piloted by the Responsible AI group. You'll follow Measurement Modeling principles (via a provided worksheet) to design a valid and reliable metric for your test set. You'll survey pre-existing datasets of harmful text and distill patterns from those sources. You'll create lexicons of terms related to each demographic factor you study. You'll write templates for synthetic data that can test for harmful patterns. And finally, you'll present the components, documentation, and datasets to obtain signoff from the Responsible AI group and product group.

Logistics Management Institute – Why Work With Us
Why LMI Our Culture Vision & Values Careers Benefits
Come to work, stay to grow.
People come to LMI because they want their work to have meaning and their contributions to have value.
In an industry full of consulting firms, LMI stands apart. Our people and our clients are what matter the most, and our expectation is that each one of our employees plays an active and immediate role in solving our clients’ toughest problems. We hire the bright minds and collaborative spirits needed to get things done, and we support them once they join LMI.
We value openness and inclusion. You’ll see broad diversity of ethnicity, gender, age, and beliefs at all levels of our organization. Our staff is a mix of experienced hires from the private sector, military veterans and spouses, retired federal civilian employees, and recent college graduates.
Our commitment to our clients lies in the ideas and solutions coming from the innovative minds of our people. That value is what has enabled LMI to grow steadily over the past 55 years into the successful and stable organization we are today.
We protect and grow the investments we have made in each hiring decision by offering competitive pay, generous benefits, continuing education opportunities, flexible schedules, performance rewards programs, and a range of rich work-life programs and affinity groups.
Year after year, LMI wins recognition for being a great place to work:
The Washington Post ranked LMI first in the ""Largest Company"" category of its 2021 Top Workplaces in the National Capital Region list.
Recognized as a “Best for Vets” employer by Military Times for ten consecutive years.
Chosen as one of Washington Business Journal’s “Healthiest Employers” in 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011.
Named as one of the Greater Washington area’s “Best Places to Work” for 2013 and 2012 by the Washington Business Journal.
Chosen as one of “Washington’s Great Places to Work” in Washingtonian magazine.
Chosen as a “Military-Friendly Employer” by the Military Officers Association of America, MOAA magazine.
Recipient of The Principal® 10 Best Companies for Employee Financial Security award.
Not surprisingly, over a quarter of our personnel have been with LMI for 10 years or longer, and we have a staff with an average of seven years. And within the last year, approximately one half of our new hires come through employee referrals—a testament to the enthusiasm our employees feel for LMI.

The Democracy Initiative Center and the College and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences seeks a motivated Education Equity Data Scientist for the newly created Equity Center.

The Democracy Initiative Center for the Redress of Inequity Through Community-Engaged Scholarship (the “Equity Center”) is the University of Virginia’s newest collaborative multi-disciplinary center, established in August 2019. The Equity Center tangibly redresses racial and socioeconomic inequality in university communities by advancing a transformative approach to universities’ fundamental research mission, which will in turn reform institutional values, pedagogy and operations. Specifically, the Equity Center will change the way that University of Virginia (UVA) scholars interact with members of the surrounding community, replacing a model that has been extractive with one that is respectful and collaborative and conducts research that benefits communities. This approach will be a model for institutions of higher education domestically and globally to leverage their anchor positions in local communities to eradicate racial and socioeconomic inequity.

Employer Summary
1904labs provides a strong benefits package not typically associated with growing companies. We provide access to healthcare (PPO, HSA), FSA (medical and dependent care), vision, dental, life insurance, access to a 401(k) with company match, short and long term disability, etc.

We also believe in our folks taking time to step away and come back renewed and refreshed. For this reason we provide 3 weeks accrued PTO annually and follow a typical national holiday schedule. Additionally we have a holiday week shutdown during the last week of the year.

Feb 14, 2018
★★★★★Current Software Developer
Insurance is great for individuals, but gets pricey as you add spouse/dependents. Additionally, they use an FSA instead of an HSA which many employers have switched to so that employees do not lose savings at the end of the year; very inconvenient to have to worry about this and is often better to simply not use it. The 401k match is lower than most places at a max of 2%.

697,"Senior or Staff Research Scientist, Data Fusion, Automated Mapping Platform (AMP)",$86K - $158K (Glassdoor est.),"Since antiquity, when sea routes and land routes were perilous for people and goods, having up to date and highly accurate maps have been a requirement for safe travel. These maps were patchworks of military sketches, captain logs, and merchant updates, and over the centuries became more and more detailed. In an era of growing vehicle automation, having up-to-date and highly accurate maps is equally critical to ensuring safe vehicle operation both on the highway and on surface roads. Yet map building remains an extensive and highly manual process, meaning real-time high definition map updates often propagate through to the user with a delay of months or years from the date when they were collected, rendering them useless beyond limited driver-assist functions. It is time for a new paradigm.

At TRI, our work is guided by a dedication to safety – in how we research, develop, and validate the performance of vehicle technology to benefit society. As a subsidiary of Toyota, TRI is fueled by a diverse and inclusive community of people who carry invaluable leadership, experience, and ideas from industry-leading companies. Over half of our technical team carries Ph.D. degrees. We’re continually searching for the world’s best talent ‒ people who are ready to define the new world of mobility with us!

But we’re always intent on ensuring associates and their families take time to enjoy the things that matter most to them. We know our people have countless commitments and responsibilities. We’re doing all we can to give them the freedom and flexibility they need to manage all aspects of their lives — comfortably, confidently and effectively. In every sense, we stand with and are here for our people — every step of the way.

Jan 25, 2019
★★★★★Current Employee
Chargify appears cheap in the grande scheme of things regarding benefits. Health insurance has been changed many times. 401K matching was once offered, but is no longer an option. Feels a bit like a bait and switch that many things were changed / yanked and benefits give the overall feeling that no one cares about the health and overall happiness of the employees.

Data is at the core of Outreach's strategy. It drives our customers and ourselves to the highest levels of success. We use it for everything from customer health scores and revenue dashboards, to operational metrics of our AWS infrastructure, to helping increase product engagement and user productivity through automated natural language understanding, to predictive analytics and causal inference via experimentation. As our customer base continues to grow, we are looking towards new ways of leveraging our data to save our customers time and improve their sales efficiency.

It is simply not competitive in the 21st century to not offer contractors access to a 401K after 6 months. Your recruiters do not help matters when they tell perspective candidates that 401k access before 1 year is average for recruiting firms. Most of the recruiting firms that I have encountered of late all offer 401k access after 6 month, some even after 3 months.

Being part of Oncology at GSK is being part of something special. The focus of the organization is clear – we are fulled by a personal passion to give our patients and our customers MORE.

The Multi-Channel Marketing (MCM) team exists to increase GSK’s ability to meet customer and patient needs in a rapidly changing world where technology demands a different approach.

The best benefit of sky zone was the employee discount. Perfect for kids right out or in high school

Wasn't anything crazy. We did get to jump a free hour. Had monthly team nights to jump and get know each other.

Working there is amazing because of the work enviornment. It's truly a place where you'll have a second family and meet people of diverse backgrounds. They are lots of fun but also about their business:
